        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Our College Football Power Ratings are designed to predict closing Vegas point spreads with high accuracy.
          The model incorporates 15 key metrics with strong historical correlation to market lines (Pearson |r| â‰¥ 0.40 or p &lt; 0.05) from 2019-2024.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The power rating for each team represents the expected margin of victory against an average FBS team on a neutral field.
          For example, a team with a power rating of 25.0 would be expected to beat an average team (rating of 0.0) by 25 points.

            Unlike many systems that focus on descriptive statistics or pure win probability, our ratings are specifically designed to predict point spreads. They incorporate market-based metrics and situational factors that traditional statistical models often miss.

          <Typography>
            In backtesting against 2019-2024 data, our model has demonstrated a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.8 points against closing spreads, with 54.7% accuracy against the spread when using a standard -110 threshold. This represents a statistically significant edge over random chance.

            Yes, our preseason and early-season ratings incorporate coaching change impacts and transfer portal movement. These factors are weighted based on historical precedent of similar changes. As the season progresses, actual on-field data gradually replaces these prior assumptions.
